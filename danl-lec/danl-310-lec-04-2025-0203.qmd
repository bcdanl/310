## Make a plot
### `ggplot` Themes

- Use `theme()` if you want to tweak the display of an existing theme.  

- The following lists basic `ggplot` themes:  

theme            | theme
-----------------|-----------------
theme_grey()     | theme_gray()
theme_bw()       | theme_linedraw()
theme_light()    | theme_dark()
theme_minimal()  | theme_classic()
theme_void()     | theme_test()



## Make a plot
### ggplot Themes

- `ggthemes` package provides the following themes:
  - `theme_economist()`, `theme_wsj()`, `theme_fivethirtyeight()`, `theme_gdocs()`, `theme_map()`


- `hrbrthemes` package provides the following themes:
  - `theme_ipsum()`, `theme_ipsum_rc()`, `theme_ft_rc()`, and more.
  
  

## Make a plot
### `gapminder` data

- The `gapminder` package include the `gapminder` data frame.

```{.r}
library(gapminder)
gapminder
skim(gapminder)

```




## Make a plot
### Mappings link data to things we see 
:::{.nonincremental}
- First, we tell the core `ggplot` function what our data is and what our aesthetic mapping is:
```{.r}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder)
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp))
```


- We can then add the geometric object (`geom_*()`) to the `ggplot()`.

```{.r}
p + geom_point() 
```


:::



## Make a plot

1. Tell the `ggplot()` function what our **tidy** data is. 
  - `ggplot(data = ...)`
2. Tell `ggplot()` what relationships we want to see.
  - The `ggplot(mapping = aes(...))` 
  - `p <- ggplot(data = ... , aes(...))`
3. Tell `ggplot()` how we want to see the relationships in our data.
  - Choose a `geom_*()`.
4. Layer on `geoms` as needed, by adding them to the `p` object one at a time.
5. Use additional functions to adjust scales, labels, tick marks, titles, etc.




## Make a plot
### Build your plots layer by layer

```{.r}
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth() 
p + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") 
p + geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```


```{.r}
p + geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "gam")
```



## Make a plot
### Mapping aesthetics vs setting them

:::{.nonincremental}
- In the following, we map `color` to `continent` in the `aes()` function:
```{.r}
p1 <-  ggplot(data = gapminder,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
                           color = continent))
```

- We then add geoms.
```{.r}
p1 + geom_point() +
     geom_smooth(method = "lm") 
```


:::


## Make a plot
### Mapping aesthetics vs setting them

:::{.nonincremental}

- In the following, we map `color` to `"purple"` outside of the `aes()` function:

```{.r}
p2 <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
```

- We then add geoms, manually set aethetics, and then adjust scales.
```{.r}
p2 + geom_point(color = "purple") +
     geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

:::


## Make a plot
### Mapping aesthetics vs setting them
:::{.nonincremental}


- Here are another exmaples that set aesthetic mapping manually outside `aes()` function and inside `geom_*()` function.
```{.r}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp))

p + geom_point(color = "purple") +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") 

p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
    geom_smooth(color = "orange", se = F, size = 8, method = "lm") 
```

:::

## Make a plot
### Mapping aesthetics vs setting them

:::{.nonincremental}

- Let's add `scale_*()` and `labs()` functions to `ggplot()`

```{.r}
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
    geom_smooth(method = "gam") +
    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
    labs(x = "GDP Per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy in Years",
         title = "Economic Growth and Life Expectancy",
         subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
         caption = "Source: Gapminder.")
```

- **Q**. Is it really the best way to display this country-year data? 
  - What are we gaining and losing by ignoring the temporal and country-level structure of the data? How could we do better? 

:::


## Make a plot
### Aesthetics can be mapped per geom

- We can have different aesthetic mappings across different geoms:
```{.r}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, 
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))

p + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = continent)) +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess")  +
    scale_x_continuous(trans = scales::log_trans())  # natural log
```




## Make a plot
### Save your work

- We can use `ggsave()` to save ggplot output as a *.png or *.pdf file.
```{.r}
ggsave(filename = "my_figure.png")
```

- We can put our recent plot into an object called p_out and then tell `ggave()` that we want to save that object.

```{.r}
p_out <- p + geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    scale_x_log10()
ggsave("my_figure.pdf", plot = p_out)
```



## Make a plot
### Save your work


- We can set the size of ggplot figue:

```{.r}
ggsave("lifexp_vs_gdp_gradient.pdf",
       plot = p_out, height = 8, width = 10, units = "in")
```





## Make a plot
### Work a little more with `gapminder` data

- What happens when you put the `geom_smooth()` function before `geom_point()` instead of after it? 
  - What does this tell you about how the plot is drawn? Think about how this might be useful when drawing plots.
  


## Make a plot
### Work a little more with `gapminder` data

- Change the mappings in the `aes()` function so that you plot Life Expectancy against population (`pop`) rather than per capita GDP. 
  - What does that look like? 
  - What does it tell you about the unit of observation in the dataset?
  



## Make a plot
### Work a little more with `gapminder` data
- What happens if you map color to `year` instead of `continent`? 
  - Is the result what you expected? 
  - Think about what class of object year is. 
  - Remember you can get a quick look at the top of the data, which includes some shorthand information on the class of each variable, by typing `gapminder`.
  - Instead of mapping `color = year`, what happens if you try `color = factor(year)`?
