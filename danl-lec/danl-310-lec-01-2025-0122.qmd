## Instructor
### Economics, Data Science, and Climate Change

- Choe, B.H. and Ore-Monago, T., 2024. "Governance and Climate Finance in the Developing World"

- **Climate finance** refers to the financial resources allocated for mitigating and adapting to climate change, including support for initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate impacts.
  - We focus on transnational financing that rich countries provide poor countries with financial resources, in order to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
  - Since the GHG emissions in developing countries are rapidly growing, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of climate finance.
  - Poor governance can be significant barriers to emissions reductions within these countries.

- Choe, B.H. and Ore-Monago, T., 2024. "Governance and Climate Finance in the Developing World"

- Data include:
  - Global climate finance data (e.g., donors, recipients, characteristics of climate change projects)
  - World Bank Governance Indicators over the years (e.g., government effectiveness, voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption)
  - Various economic indicators (e.g., trade pattern of low carbon technology products, macroeconomic risks, energy)

- Key topics include: 
  1. Exploring a variety of graph types, including line graphs, scatter plots, and bar charts.
  2. Preparing and organizing data from diverse sources for visualization.
  3. Tailoring graphics with a range of formats and styles, such as color schemes, fonts, and line types.
  4. Mapping geographical data effectively.
  5. Creating dynamic and interactive visualizations.
  6. Building and deploying web applications using Shiny for data visualization.

<!-- ## Syllabus -->
<!-- ### Netiquette Policy for Online Discussions -->

<!-- - Before posting your question to a discussion board, check if anyone has asked it already and received a reply. Just as you would not repeat a topic of discussion right after it happened in real life, do not do that in discussion boards either. -->
<!-- - Stay on topic - Do not post irrelevant inks. comments, thoughts, or pictures. -->
<!-- - Do not type in all capital letters. If you do, it will look like you are screaming. -->
<!-- - Do not write anything that sounds angry or sarcastic, even as a joke, because without hearing your tone of voice, your peers might not realize you are joking. -->
<!-- - Always remember to say "Please" and "Thank you" when soliciting help from your peers or an instructor. -->
<!-- - Respect the opinions of your classmates. If you feel the need to disagree, do so respectfully and acknowledge the valid points in your peers' arguments. Acknowledge that others are entitled to have their own perspective on the issue. -->
<!-- - If you reply to a question from a peer, make sure your answer is accurate! If you are not 100% when the homework is due, do not guess. Otherwise, you could really mess things up for your peers and they will not appreciate it. -->
<!-- - Be brief. If you write a long dissertation in response to a simple question, it is unlikely that anyone will spend the time to read through it all. -->
<!-- - If you ask a question and many people respond, summarize all answers and post that summary to benefit your whole class. -->
<!-- - Do not badmouth others or call them stupid. You may disagree with their ideas, but do not mock the person. -->
<!-- - If you refer to something your peers said earlier in the discussion, quote just a few key lines from their post so that others wont have to go back and figure out which post you re referring to. -->
<!-- - Be forgiving. If your peer makes a mistake, do not badger him or her for it. Just let it go - it happens to the best of us. -->
<!-- - Run a spelling and grammar check before posting anything to the discussion board. It only takes a minute, and can make the difference between sounding like a fool and sounding knowledgeable. -->

## Why Data Analytics?

- Fill in the gaps left by traditional business and economics classes.
  - Practical skills that will benefit your future career.
  - Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.

- Data analytics skills are largely distinct from (and complementary to) the core quantitative works familiar to business undergrads.
  - Data visualization, cleaning and wrangling; databases; machine learning; etc.

- In short, we will cover things that I wish someone had taught me when I was undergraduate.

## The State of the Art
### Generative AI and ChatGPT

- **Generative AI** refers to a category of artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of generating new content, ranging from text, images, and videos to music and code. 

:::{.incremental}

- In the early 2020s, advances in transformer-based deep neural networks enabled a number of generative AI systems notable for accepting natural language prompts as input.
  - These include large language model (LLM) chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Gemini, LLaMA, Grok).

- **ChatGPT** (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. 
  - By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.

## The State of the Art
### Generative AI and ChatGPT

  
- Users around the world have explored how to best utilize GPT for writing essays and programming codes.


::::{.incremental}

:::{}
- Is AI a threat to data analytics?
  - Fundamental understanding of the subject matter is still crucial for effectively utilizing AI's capabilities.
:::

:::{}
- If you use Generative AI such as ChatGPT, please try to understand what ChatGPT gives you.
  - Copying and pasting it without any understanding harms your learning opportunity.

## Installing the Tools
### R Packages and `tidyverse`

- **R packages** are collections of R functions, compiled code, and data that are combined in a structured format.


:::{.incremental}

- The `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 
  - The `tidyverse` packages work harmoniously together to make data manipulation, exploration, and visualization more.
  - We will use several R packages from `tidyverse` throughout the course. (e.g., `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`)

:::


## Installing the Tools
### Installing R packages with `install.packages("packageName")`

- R packages can be easily installed from within R using functions  `install.packages("packageName")`. 
  - To install the R package `tidyverse`, type and run the following from R console:

:::{.incremental}
```{.r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


- While running the above codes, you may encounter the question below from the R Console:


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Mac**: *"Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?"* from Console Pane.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Windows**: *"Would you like to use a personal library instead?"* from Pop-up message.
:::
::::

- Type `no` in the R Console, and then hit *Enter*.

:::

## Installing the Tools
### Loading R packages with `library(packageName)`

- Once installed, a package is loaded into an R session using `library(packageName)` so that its functions and data can be used.
  - To load the R package `tidyverse`, type and run the following command from a R script:

```{.r}
library(tidyverse)
df_mpg <- mpg
```

:::{.incremental}
- `mpg` is the data.frame provided by the R package `ggplot2`, one of the R pakcages in `tidyverse`.

## Installing the Tools 
### Python in RStudio

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Option 

- We can run Python codes within RStudio.

- Select Python interpreter in RStudio from **Tools** $>$ **Global Options** $>$ **Python**:

## R package, `reticulate`

- Install the R package, `reticulate`
```{.r}
install.packages("reticulate")
```

- This package allows `Quarto` to use Python and R objects interactively within one Quarto document.
