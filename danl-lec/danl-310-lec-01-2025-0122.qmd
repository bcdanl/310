### Course Description

- This course delves into the tools and methodologies essential for creating visually engaging and informative data representations. Its focus is on enhancing data comprehension and facilitating effective data analytics through aesthetically pleasing graphics. The curriculum includes: 

- Key topics include: 
  1. Exploring a variety of graph types, including line graphs, scatter plots, and bar charts.
  2. Preparing and organizing data from diverse sources for visualization.
  3. Tailoring graphics with a range of formats and styles, such as color schemes, fonts, and line types.
  4. Mapping geographical data effectively.
  5. Creating dynamic and interactive visualizations.
  6. Building and deploying web applications using Shiny for data visualization.
  7. Utilizing Shiny dashboard to synthesize information and narrate data stories.
  
- These areas will be explored through detailed, real-world examples to address common data analysis challenges. 

- Throughout the course, practical experience is emphasized, with hands-on projects using tools like R, Python, RStudio, Quarto, Jupyter Notebook, Shiny, Git, and GitHub.

## Syllabus
### Grading

- You are allowed up to 2 absences without penalty. 
  - Send me an email if you have standard excused reasons (illness, family emergency, transportation problems, etc.).

- For each absence beyond the initial two, there will be a deduction of 1% from the Total Percentage Grade.

- Participation will be evaluated by quantity and quality of GitHub-based online discussions and in-person discussion.

- The single lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the total homework score. 

  




## Syllabus
### Make-up Policy

-  Make-up exams will not be given unless you have either a medically verified excuse or an absence excused by the University.

- If you cannot take exams because of religious obligations, notify me by email at least two weeks in advance so that an alternative exam time may be set.

- A missed exam without an excused absence earns a grade of zero.

- Late submissions for homework assignment will be accepted with a penalty. 

- A zero will be recorded for a missed assignment.

## Installing the Tools
### R Packages and `tidyverse`

- **R packages** are collections of R functions, compiled code, and data that are combined in a structured format.

- The `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 
  - The `tidyverse` packages work harmoniously together to make data manipulation, exploration, and visualization more.
  - We will use several R packages from `tidyverse` throughout the course. (e.g., `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`)



## Installing the Tools
### Installing R packages with `install.packages("packageName")`

- R packages can be easily installed from within R using functions  `install.packages("packageName")`. 
  - To install the R package `tidyverse`, type and run the following from R console:

```{.r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


- While running the above codes, you may encounter the question below from the R Console:


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Mac**: *"Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?"* from Console Pane.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Windows**: *"Would you like to use a personal library instead?"* from Pop-up message.
:::
::::

- Type `no` in the R Console, and then hit *Enter*.



## Installing the Tools
### Loading R packages with `library(packageName)`

- Once installed, a package is loaded into an R session using `library(packageName)` so that its functions and data can be used.
  - To load the R package `tidyverse`, type and run the following command from a R script:

```{.r}
library(tidyverse)
df_mpg <- mpg
```


- `mpg` is the data.frame provided by the R package `ggplot2`, one of the R pakcages in `tidyverse`.
